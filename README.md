# Prohealth

### Introduction:

As a computer science engineering student I want to contribute to the betterment of the existing medical system available in my country. Using concepts of automated alerts, open-sourcing valuable data and information from hospitals and health care institutions without losing the confidentiality of critical information, and AI prediction algorithms to ensure better health for patients. 

The idea is to be implemented as an upgrade to the existing digitization employed in hospitals. Hospitals are storing patient data including age, the diseases they have, the date of their visit, follow-up dates, medications etc. 

**Prohealth** aims to minimize the fatalities created due to the following reasons:

- Patients missing or forgetting their follow-ups visits.   
- Failing to predict an ailment that might arise in near future based on present health conditions.
- Wastage of time and resource created by lack of data sharing among health institutions.

### SCQ analysis:

#### S (Situation)

- Patients missing or forgetting their follow-ups visits.   
- Failure to predict an ailment that might arise in near future based on present health conditions.
- Wastage of time and resource created by lack of data sharing among health institutions.

#### C (Challenge)

- getting valid data sets for training the prediction models.
- getting hospitals to share their valuable data.

#### Q (Question)

- Can predefined alerts encourage patients to visit hospitals for follow-ups?
- Can the prediction model be trusted?
- Will hospitals direct funding to share their data?
- Can the data shared be protected from theft and misuse?


## Proposed solutions:

- Creation of a software application driven by powerful prediction algorithms while being backed up by a unified database of strong information collected from different hospitals. 

- Creating and training a model with available data and verify the accuracy of the prediction result.

- Mapping patients with their follow-up date along with a score for their ailment (to determine the seriousness of coming on time for follow-up) and send alerts via mail, registered numbers as messages and in extreme stages notifying the hospital authorities to initiate action if the patient does not turn up.
